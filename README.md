# OOP-HUD-Assignment-2016
The HUD Assignment for OOP 2016.

The HUD in this assignment is based on the HUD found on the Boeing 737NG's. They did not originally get fitted to the 737NG's, and only recently have they been offered as an option to airlines that are ordering these aircraft.

Planned Features:
- Fully animated HUD
- Interact with the user so that they can increase speed and then take off
- Flap extension
- Takeoff Callouts
- Turning left or right
- Gear up and down animation + sound
