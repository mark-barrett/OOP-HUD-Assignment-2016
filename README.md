# OOP-HUD-Assignment-2016
The HUD Assignment for OOP 2016.

The HUD in this assignment is based on the HUD found onboard some of the Boeing 737NG's and a HUD you would find in a modern day/conceptual fighter get. They did not originally get fitted to the 737NG's, and only recently have they been offered as an option to airlines that are ordering these aircraft.

Features:
- Fully animated HUD
- Interact with the user so that they can increase speed and then take off
- Flap extension
- Takeoff Callouts
- Turning left or right
- Gear up and down animation + sound
